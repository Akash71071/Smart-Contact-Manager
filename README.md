# Smart-Contact-Manager
I developed this website using java springboot framework.
This Project is made in Java.I have used SpringBoot Framework for back-end and Hibernate for Database and Thymeleaf for front-end.
A contact manager is a software program that enables users to easily store and find contact information, such as names, addresses, and telephone numbers. 
They are contact-centric databases that provide a fully integrated approach to tracking all information and communication activities linked to contacts.
